# What is inside?

The data that we have on CareSpan include the following

* Patient Demographics
* Billing Records
* Patient Medical Records, including media files
  * PDF files
  * Image files
  * Audio files
  * Flat files



```bash
npm run build
```

The static files are generated in the `build` folder.

## Deploy your site

Test your production build locally:

```bash
npm run serve
```

The `build` folder is now served at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

You can now deploy the `build` folder **almost anywhere** easily, **for free** or very small cost (read the **[Deployment Guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment)**).
